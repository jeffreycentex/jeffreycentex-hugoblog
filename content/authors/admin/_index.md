Hi.  My name is Jeffrey.  By day, I do healthcare informatics and other healthcare IT tasks for a mid sized medical practice in San Antonio, TX.  By night, I am a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the Georgia Institute of Technology for the OMSCS (Online Masters in Computer Science) program.  I am also a student of the OMSCS program with a projected graduation of Spring 2021 (I will complete my classes in Fall 2020, but due to CoVID, I'm postponing graduation till Spring).  I teach the Computer Networks class (CS 6250) specializing in Software Defined Networking and have tought the Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems class (CS 6200) which is actually a bit tougher than you would expect an introduction class.
